            service, and product selection. Learn best practices from peer stores and see how art and science play a

            <strong>Effective Ways to Reduce Prejudice and Create an Inclusive Climate</strong> - Naomi Isenberg - Many
            pro-diversity initiatives
            have one shortcoming: They don't work! Reviewing empirical studies conducted by our and other research
            teams, I discuss
            effective ways to get people to develop positive attitudes towards members of other social groups and to
            engage in
            inclusive behaviors (in schools, organizations, and communities). Naomi is a fifth year PhD student in
            social psychology
            at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She is advised by Dr. Markus Brauer and her research primarily
            focuses on
            examining different behavioral mechanisms for promoting inclusive behavior change. She also enjoys running
            inclusion
            workshops and sharing her research with communities outside of psychology. To learn more, you can visit her

            gifts are placed in
            a central location, and each person that brings a gift is given a number. The first person opens a wrapped
            gift and the turn ends. On subsequent turns, each person gets the choice of “stealing” any unwrapped item or
            choosing a wrapped one from the gift pile. When a player's gift is stolen, they can choose to steal an
            opened gift (2 Steal limit) or select a replacement gift from the pile of wrapped presents. Each turn ends
            when a gift is unwrapped. The game is over when the last person has taken their turn. Everyone is welcome to
            play!!! The more gifts the more fun so make sure to bring one!</td>
