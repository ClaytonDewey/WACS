            gift and the turn ends. On subsequent turns, each person gets the choice of “stealing” any unwrapped item or
            choosing a wrapped one from the gift pile. When a player's gift is stolen, they can choose to steal an
            opened gift (2 Steal limit) or select a replacement gift from the pile of wrapped presents. Each turn ends
            when a gift is unwrapped. The game is over when the last person has taken their turn. Everyone is welcome to
            play!!! The more gifts the more fun so make sure to bring one!</td>

            to support product layout and placement on your sales floor to capture your customer's attention, elevate
            their shopping
            experience, and stimulate their buying decisions. This session is ideal for the operations/buying teams that
